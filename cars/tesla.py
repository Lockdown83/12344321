# To calculate the force in newtons of an atom bomb, we need to understand the energy released during the explosion.
# The energy released by an atomic bomb can be approximated using the formula E = mc^2, where:
# E is the energy in joules,
# m is the mass of the material undergoing fission (in kilograms),
# c is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 3 x 10^8 meters/second).

# For this example, let's assume a small atomic bomb releases about 15 kilotons of TNT equivalent energy.
# 1 kiloton of TNT is approximately 4.184 x 10^12 joules.
# Therefore, 15 kilotons of TNT is:
energy_released = 15 * 4.184e12  # in joules

# The force can be calculated using the formula F = E / d, where:
# F is the force in newtons,
# E is the energy in joules,
# d is the distance over which the force is applied (in meters).
# For simplicity, let's assume the distance is 1 meter.

distance = 1  # in meters
force = energy_released / distance  # in newtons

# Now we can print the calculated force
print(f"The force generated by the atomic bomb is approximately {force:.2e} newtons.")
